      <p>my mind is full of wires and these wires make out different paths. and somewhere there is a gateway that connects to heaven. data can be downloaded from anywhere; I can choose from where.</p>
      
      <p>if a thought means the difference between you living and dying, choose the thought that will help you to live. choose the most peaceful and possible thought train: I am surrounded by love, Christ is the source of all love and I am rooted and made full/whole in Christ, no matter what happens in the days to come, and I donâ€™t have to know right now, because I am already whole right now. </p>

          the apple orchard speaks for itself. the right way out is always through. edges are softer now, and people less blurry. she floats, and verily, she cannot be pinned down.
          dragonflies are secretly angels; at least I remind myself.

          my name means pleiade, up in the night-sky. my friend won the lottery, and I did too. once it all cools down, the 
          colors make sense again. once it all cools down, I am made new.

    <p>an indigo child is slipping through and not forever</p>
    <p>if an impulse can have the effect of giving me life or taking, I can refrain</p>
    <p>I can choose the most merciful possible thought path. this will lead to the default gateway. the most peaceful thought path is:</p>
    <p><i>
      I am surrounded by love<br>
      I am overflowing with love<br>
      real love asks "what can I give?" without insisting in its own way<br>
      I can rest knowing that God's hand is on it
    </p></i>
    <p>I know very very little. I'm a girl like any other, and these are my encrypted thoughts.</p>
