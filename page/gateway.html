      <p>my mind is full of wires and these wires make out different paths. and somewhere there is a gateway that connects to heaven. data can be downloaded from anywhere; I can be careful from where.</p>
      
      <p>if a thought means the difference between you living and dying, choose the thought that will help you to live. choose the most peaceful and possible thought train: I am surrounded by love, Christ is the source of all love and I am rooted and made full/whole in Christ, no matter what happens in the days to come, and I donâ€™t have to know right now, because I am already whole right now. </p>

      <p>an indigo child is slipping through and not forever</p>
      <p>if an impulse can have the effect of giving me life or taking, I can refrain</p>
      <p>I can choose the most merciful possible thought path. this will lead to the default gateway. the most peaceful thought path is:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>I am surrounded by love</li>
        <li>I am overflowing with love</li>
        <li>real love asks "what can I give?" without insisting in its own way</li>
        <li>I can rest knowing that God's hand is on it</li>
      </ul>
      <p></p>
      <p>I know very very little. I'm a girl like any other, and these are my encrypted thoughts.</p>
