      <p>my mind is full of wires and these wires make out different pathways. and somewhere there is a gateway that connects to heaven. data can be downloaded from anywhere; I can choose from where.</p>
      
      <p>I can choose the thought that gives life; the most peaceful possible thought-train.

      <p>and a lot of times people are and once you get to know them it is revealed
        and the more i look for that in others the more I myself will display it
        the more beauty i see in others the more I will outpour
        the more surrounded I will be with love

I have it within me

        yesterday, I found another goldmine of virtual memoriabillia. <a href="https://gifcities.org/" target="_blank">gifcities.org</a> is a web archive
        of animated gifs from the 90s era of the internet. It sources most of its search results from old geocities pages.

          the apple orchard speaks for itself. the right way out is always through. edges are softer now, and people less blurry. she floats, and verily, she cannot be pinned down.
          dragonflies are secretly angels; at least I remind myself.

          my name means pleiade, up in the night-sky. my friend won the lottery, and I did too. once it all cools down, the 
          colors make sense again. once it all cools down, I am made new.

    <p>I can choose the most merciful possible thought path. this will lead to the default gateway. the most peaceful thought path is:</p>
    <p><i>
      I am surrounded by love<br>
      I am overflowing with love<br>
      real love asks "what can I give?" without insisting in its own way<br>
      I can rest knowing that God's hand is on it
    </p></i>
    <p>I know very very little. I'm a girl like any other, and these are my encrypted thoughts.</p>
