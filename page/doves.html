        doves are a biblical symbol of the Holy Spirit. a notable example is when a dove
        brought an olive branch to Noah after the flood, indicating that land was near.
        this represents God's peace and forgiveness.

        in another part of scripture, the Holy Spirit is described as "descending as a dove".
        the imagery of the dove, with its white wings and round features, evokes feelings of
        purity, otherworldliness and gentleness.

        did you know that pigeons are multi-colored doves? they are common in New York because people
        used to keep them as pets back in the day.
